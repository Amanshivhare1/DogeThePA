We are a wedding tech platform startup ‚Äî aiming to build the biggest monopolistic company in the Indian wedding industry, a $130 billion market.

We are creating a wed-tech platform for vendors and couples to connect, with AI to visualize weddings beforehand. We‚Äôre also offering SaaS tools for vendors to manage and redesign their inventory, and providing services for rituals and astrological needs. We're building a dark store to store all this material, similar to Zepto, and an app to order all fashion jewelry ‚Äî from big brands like Sabyasachi and Manish Malhotra, to local giants in Chandni Chowk and Sadar Bazaar ‚Äî which are the key markets for budget wedding shopping across India. Globally, we plan to expand by introducing music festivals named ‚ÄúLovers Card‚Äù and entering the matchmaking and dating industry.

I truly and genuinely require your help ‚Äî more than just money ‚Äî because your guidance can turn our monopolistic vision into a reality, and make it happen faster. I‚Äôm looking for the kind of support VCs offer in their earliest days.

I also got into Shark Tank India Season 4 (first round) and helped design the very famous Ambani wedding with the main wedding planner. There is still no major company dominating this massive market in India.
